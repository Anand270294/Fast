# Fast
A library for Linear Algebra Calculations (In Progress). **__Fast__** allows users to perform linear algebra calculations in *python* faster than native *python* language or even `Numpy` since **__Fast__** uses *PyBind11* to wrap C++ code into a *python* object. Furthermore, **__Fast__** utilises **Eigen3** Library which specialises in linear algebra calculations and **OpenMP** to allow parallel matrix calculations to boost performance.

## System Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. C++ 11.0
3. OpenCL and Grpahics Drivers depending on the User's Graphics Card
4. PyBind11
5. Eigen3 Library
